Introduction to Machine Learning
Description 
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning: 
Involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where there algorithm learns from both input data and corresponding labels. 

Unsupervised learning:
Involves training a model on an unlabeled datasets, where the algorithm learns patterns and structures from the input data without explicit output labels.

Semi - Supervised learning:
 Combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning, utilizing a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data.

 Reinforcement Learning: 
Involves training agents to make decisions within an environment to achieve a specific goal, where the agent learns through trial and error by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.



Applications of Machine Learning:
1. Predictive Analytics:
 Forecasting future trends and behaviors based on historical data.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
 Understanding and generating human language, including tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

3. Image Recognition and Computer Vision:
 Identifying and analyzing patterns in visual data, such as object detection, facial recognition, and medical image analysis.

4. Recommendation Systems:
 Providing personalized recommendations to users based on their past behaviors and preferences.

5. Anomaly Detection:
 Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data that may indicate fraudulent activity, system failures, or other anomalies.

6. Healthcare: 
Assisting in disease diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery.

7. Autonomous Vehicles:
 Enabling vehicles to perceive their environment and make decisions without human intervention.



Main Tasks in Machine Learning:
1. Data Preprocessing:
 Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for training models.

2. Feature Engineering:
 Selecting or creating the most relevant features from the raw data to improve model performance.

3. Model Training:
 Using algorithms to train models on labeled data (in supervised learning) or to find patterns in data (in unsupervised learning).

4. Model Evaluation:
 Assessing the performance of trained models using various metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation and confusion matrices.

5. Model Deployment: 
Integrating trained models into production environments to make predictions on new, unseen data.
